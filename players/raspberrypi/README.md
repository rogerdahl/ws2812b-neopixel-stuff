#### WS2812B Effect Player for Raspberry Pi

This is a player for effects that use [WS2812B / Adafruit NeoPixel RGB LEds](https://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812B.pdf). The player is based on the [ws2811 library by Jeremy Garff](https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x) and the [Wiring Pi library by Gordon Henderson](http://wiringpi.com/).

See the [main page](README.md) for more information on players, effects, and how to build platforms that can run these.
